/*PLL0 initialization routine for LPC17xx controller
 *
 * LPC17xx controllers have three clock sources:
 * Main oscillator: external (on-board)
 * Internal RC oscillator: used after power-up/reset
 * RTC oscillator: 1 Hz low-power oscillator for RTC
 *
 * There are also two PLLs that can be used:
 * PLL0:
 * Used by CPU and peripherals
 * CLCSRCSEL register: selects clock
 *
 * PLL1:
 * provides 48 MHz to USB subsystem
 * Disabled and powered off after power-up/reset
 *
 * After power-up, the CPU is running on the internal RC oscillator. I wrote a routine in C to switch to PLL0 at 100MHz. The routine basically follows the user manual and implements all the steps given in the manua
