In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously feasible.

A pre-trained model is a network that's already been trained on a large dataset and saved, which allows you to use it to customize your own model cheaply and efficiently. The one you'll be using, MobileNetV2, was designed to provide fast and computationally efficient performance. It's been pre-trained on ImageNet, a dataset containing over 14 million images and 1000 classes.

In recent years, neural networks have become much deeper, with state-of-the-art networks evolving from having just a few layers (e.g., AlexNet) to over a hundred layers.
The main benefit of a very deep network is that it can represent very complex functions. It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the shallower layers, closer to the input) to very complex features (at the deeper layers, closer to the output).
However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow.
More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backpropagate from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and "explode," from gaining very large values).
During training, you might therefore see the magnitude (or norm) of the gradient for the shallower layers decrease to zero very rapidly as training proceeds, as shown below:

The lecture mentioned that having ResNet blocks with the shortcut also makes it very easy for one of the blocks to learn an identity function. This means that you can stack on additional ResNet blocks with little risk of harming training set performance.
On that note, there is also some evidence that the ease of learning an identity function accounts for ResNets' remarkable performance even more than skip connections help with vanishing gradients.
Two main types of blocks are used in a ResNet, depending mainly on whether the input/output dimensions are the same or different. You are going to implement both of them: the "identity block" and the "convolutional block."

The identity block is the standard block used in ResNets, and corresponds to the case where the input activation (say  𝑎[𝑙]) has the same dimension as the output activation (say  𝑎[𝑙+2]).

'''
The ResNet "convolutional block" is the second block type. You can use this type of block when the input and output dimensions don't match up. The difference with the identity block is that there is a CONV2D layer in the shortcut path:
The CONV2D layer in the shortcut path is used to resize the input  𝑥  to a different dimension, so that the dimensions match up in the final addition needed to add the shortcut value back to the main path. (This plays a similar role as the matrix  𝑊𝑠 discussed in lecture.)
For example, to reduce the activation dimensions's height and width by a factor of 2, you can use a 1x1 convolution with a stride of 2.
The CONV2D layer on the shortcut path does not use any non-linear activation function. Its main role is to just apply a (learned) linear function that reduces the dimension of the input, so that the dimensions match up for the later addition step.
